### Description

I designed this software to enable me to scan, file &amp; comment all the rubbish documents that I dare not throw away but may need one day.

You can scan the document and it puts it into the App.Path &amp; \tmpImg DIR and then goto Add to DB and add some comments &amp; a title. This is then put into the DB (access 2k) and the image is moved to App.Path &amp; \img. you can now use the viewer to view the images and you get the information about it too. Uses Mainly TIFF images and has full ROTATE, ZOOM &amp; PRINT capabilities. This is my first App and I am quite proud of it. Perfect for beginners to learn howto add scanning &amp; TIFF images to a VB project. Sorry, not all commented yet, but I will get round to it. Let me have comments please...

P.S If you have missing OCX's or DLL's, let me know and I can Email them to you. Either that or Install Imaging For Windows! ADDON - I have now put the OCX files on-line to download. Goto http://www.docserve.co.uk/ocx.zip to get em. Sorry if anyone has asked for these and not recieved them, as you can see I have had 100's of requests.
